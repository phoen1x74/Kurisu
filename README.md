# Kurisu
A Discord server bot by 916253 and ihaveamac/ihaveahax. Designed heavily around the [3DS Hacking Discord](https://discord.gg/K93KC3m).

This bot is not really intended to be used in other setups at the moment, the source is mostly available for those interested.

Uses [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

The edits I've made take up about .5% of the work. With this but running, do .apache2 to see my changes.
